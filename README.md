TinyLetter WordPress Plug-in from on ClickNathan's HTML/CSS/JS-jQuery Blog Post
=================

As [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) currently has Plug-ins based on [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com) to create form widgets for it, but no Plug-ins for their simpler [TinyLetter.com](http://tinyletter.com), we created this. It is taken directly from on Nathan Swarz's [ClickNathan Blog Post on creating a TinyLetter WordPress Plug-in](http://clicknathan.com/web-design/tinyletter-wordpress-plugin/). [Faddah Wolf](https://github.com/faddah) wanted to teach himself to create a [WordPress Plug-in](https://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin) for that, so he got Nathan's permission to create this repository and give it try.

### Version

v0.0.1b

### Current Info/Still Needed

* Created & uploaded for repository these 4 main files —
  * README.md - this descriptive file.
  * tinyletter-form.html - the <strong>form</strong> and <strong>iframe</strong> HTML part of the plug-in.
  * tinyletter-form.html - the <strong>form</strong> and <strong>iframe</strong> HTML part of the plug-in.
  * style.css — the css styling, especially for the .tinyletterhider to give response in the widget once the form is submitted to tinyletter.com.
  * tinyletter.js — the jQuery files.
* Need to now add PHP wrapper and other code to make a plug-in.
